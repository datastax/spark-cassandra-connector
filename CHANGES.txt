 * Language specific highlighting in the documentation (#105)
 * Fixed a bug which caused problems when a column of VarChar type was used
   in where clause. (04fd8d9)
 * Fixed an AnyObjectFactory bug which caused problems with instantiation of
   classes which were defined inside Scala objects. (#82)
 * Added support for Spark Streaming. (#89)
    - Added implicit wrappers which simplify access to Cassandra related
      functionality from StreamingContext and DStream.
    - Added a stub for further Spark Streaming integration tests.
 * Upgraded Java API. (#98)
    - Refactored existing Java API
    - Added CassandraJavaRDD as a JAVA counterpart of CassandraRDD
    - Added Java helpers for accessing Spark Streaming related methods
    - Added several integration tests
    - Added a documentation page for JAVA API
    - Extended Java API demo
    - Added a lot of API docs
 * Ability to register custom TypeConverters. (#32)
 * Handle null values in StringConverter. (#79)
 * Improved error message when there are no replicas in the local DC. (#69)


1.0.0 beta 2
 * DSE compatibility improvements. (#64)
    - Column types and type converters use TypeTags instead of Strings to
      announce their types.
    - CassandraRDD#tableDef is public now.
    - Added methods for getting keyspaces and tables by name from the Schema.
    - Refactored Schema class - loading schema from Cassandra moved
      from the constructor to a factory method.
    - Remove unused methods for returning system keyspaces from Schema.
 * Improved JavaDoc explaining CassandraConnector withClusterDo
   and withSessionDo semantics.
 * Support for updating counter columns. (#27)
 * Configure consistency level for reads/writes. Set default consistency
   levels to LOCAL_ONE for reads and writes. (#42)
 * Values passed as arguments to `where` are converted to proper types
   expected by the java-driver. (#26)
 * Include more information in the exception message when query in
   CassandraRDD fails. (#69)
 * Fallback to describe_ring in case describe_local_ring does not exist to
   improve compatibility with earlier Cassandra versions. (#47)
 * Session object sharing in CassandraConnector. (#41 and #53)
 * Modify cassandra.* configuration settings to prefix with "spark." so they
   can be used from spark-shell and set via conf/spark-default.conf (#51)
 * Fixed race condition in AsyncExecutor causing inaccuracy of success/failure
   counters. (#40)
 * Added Java API. Fixed a bug in ClassBasedRowReader which caused
   problems when data were read into Java beans. Added type converters
   for boxed Java primitive types. (#11)


1.0.0 beta 1
 * CassandraRDD#createStatement doesn't obtain a new session, but reuses
   the task's Session.
 * Integration tests. (#12)
 * Added contains and indexOf methods to CassandraRow. Missing value from
   CassandraRow does not break writing - null is written instead.
 * Caching of PreparedStatements. Subsequent preparations of the same
   PreparedStatement are returned from the cache and don't cause
   a warning. (#3)
 * Move partitioner ForkJoinPool to companion object to share it between RDD's.
   (#24)
 * Fixed thread-safety of ClassBasedRowReader.
 * Detailed user guide with code examples, reviewed by Kris Hahn. (#15)
 * Support for saving RDD[CassandraRow]. New demo program copying data from one
   table to another. (#16)
 * Using a PreparedStatement make createStatement method compatible with
   Cassandra 1.2.x. (#17)
 * More and better logging. Using org.apache.spark.Logging instead of log4j.
   (#13)
 * Better error message when attempting to write to a table that doesn't exist.
   (#1)
 * Added more robust scala build to allow for future clean releases, and
   publish settings for later integration. (#8)
 * Refactored classes and objects used for authentication to support pluggable
   authentication.
 * Record cause of TypeConversionException.
 * Improved error messages informing about failure to convert column value.
   Fixed missing conversion for setters.
 * Split CassandraWriter into RowWriter and TableWriter.
 * Refactored package structure. Moved classes from rdd to rdd.reader
   and rdd.partitioner packages. Renamed RowTransformers to RowReaders.
 * Fix writing ByteBuffers to Cassandra.
 * Throw meaningful exception when non-existing column is requested by name.
 * Add isNull method on CassandraRow.
 * Fix converting blobs to arrays of bytes in CassandraRow. Fix printing blobs
   and collections.
