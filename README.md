## Lightning-fast cluster computing with Spark and Cassandra

This library lets you expose Cassandra tables as Spark RDDs, write Spark RDDs to Cassandra tables, and
execute arbitrary CQL queries in your Spark applications.

## Features

 - Compatible with Apache Cassandra version 2.0 or higher (see table below)
 - Compatible with Apache Spark 1.0 through 1.5 (see table below)
 - Compatible with Scala 2.10 and 2.11
 - Exposes Cassandra tables as Spark RDDs
 - Maps table rows to CassandraRow objects or tuples
 - Offers customizable object mapper for mapping rows to objects of user-defined classes
 - Saves RDDs back to Cassandra by implicit `saveToCassandra` call
 - Join with a subset of Cassandra data using `joinWithCassandraTable` call
 - Partition RDDs according to Cassandra replication using `repartitionByCassandraReplica` call
 - Converts data types between Cassandra and Scala
 - Supports all Cassandra data types including collections
 - Filters rows on the server side via the CQL `WHERE` clause 
 - Allows for execution of arbitrary CQL statements
 - Plays nice with Cassandra Virtual Nodes
 - Works with PySpark DataFrames

## Version Compatibility

The connector project has several branches, each of which map into different supported versions of 
Spark and Cassandra. Refer to the compatibility table below which shows the major.minor 
version range supported between the connector, Spark, Cassandra, and the Cassandra Java driver:

## Download
This project is available on Spark Packages; this is the easiest way to start using the connector:
http://spark-packages.org/package/datastax/spark-cassandra-connector

This project has also been published to the Maven Central Repository.
For SBT to download the connector binaries, sources and javadoc, put this in your project 
SBT config:
                                                                                                                           
    libraryDependencies += "com.datastax.spark" %% "spark-cassandra-connector" % "1.6.0"

If you want to access the functionality of Connector from Java, you may want to add also a Java API module:

    libraryDependencies += "com.datastax.spark" %% "spark-cassandra-connector-java" % "1.6.0"

## Community
### Reporting Bugs
New issues may be reported using [JIRA](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/SPARKC/). Please include
all relevant details including versions of Spark, Spark Cassandra Connector, Cassandra and/or DSE. A minimal
reproducible case with sample code is ideal.

### Mailing List
Questions and requests for help may be submitted to the [user mailing list](http://groups.google.com/a/lists.datastax.com/forum/#!forum/spark-connector-user).

### IRC
\#spark-cassandra-connector on irc.freenode.net. If you are new to IRC, you can use a [web-based client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#spark-cassandra-connector).

### Contributing
To develop this project, we recommend using IntelliJ IDEA. 
Make sure you have installed and enabled the Scala Plugin.
Open the project with IntelliJ IDEA and it will automatically create the project structure
from the provided SBT configuration.

Before contributing your changes to the project, please make sure that all unit tests and integration tests pass.
Don't forget to add an appropriate entry at the top of CHANGES.txt.
Finally open a pull-request on GitHub and await review. 

Please prefix pull request description with the JIRA number, for example: "SPARKC-123: Fix the ...".

## Testing
To run unit and integration tests:

    ./sbt/sbt test
    ./sbt/sbt it:test

By default, integration tests start up a separate, single Cassandra instance and run Spark in local mode.
It is possible to run integration tests with your own Cassandra and/or Spark cluster.
First, prepare a jar with testing code:
    
    ./sbt/sbt test:package
    
Then copy the generated test jar to your Spark nodes and run:    

    export IT_TEST_CASSANDRA_HOST=<IP of one of the Cassandra nodes>
    export IT_TEST_SPARK_MASTER=<Spark Master URL>
    ./sbt/sbt it:test
    
## Generating Documents
To generate the Reference Document use 

    ./sbt/sbt spark-cassandra-connector-doc/run (outputLocation)
    
outputLocation defaults to doc/reference.md
