## Lightning-fast cluster computing with Apache Spark(TM) and Apache Cassandra(TM);

This library lets you expose Cassandra tables as Spark RDDs, write Spark RDDs to Cassandra tables, and
execute arbitrary CQL queries in your Spark applications.

## Features

 - Compatible with Apache Cassandra version 2.0 or higher (see table below)
 - Compatible with Apache Spark 1.0 through 2.0 (see table below)
 - Compatible with Scala 2.10 and 2.11
 - Exposes Cassandra tables as Spark RDDs
 - Maps table rows to CassandraRow objects or tuples
 - Offers customizable object mapper for mapping rows to objects of user-defined classes
 - Saves RDDs back to Cassandra by implicit `saveToCassandra` call
 - Join with a subset of Cassandra data using `joinWithCassandraTable` call
 - Partition RDDs according to Cassandra replication using `repartitionByCassandraReplica` call
 - Converts data types between Cassandra and Scala
 - Supports all Cassandra data types including collections
 - Filters rows on the server side via the CQL `WHERE` clause 
 - Allows for execution of arbitrary CQL statements
 - Plays nice with Cassandra Virtual Nodes
 - Works with PySpark DataFrames

## Version Compatibility

The connector project has several branches, each of which map into different
supported versions of  Spark and Cassandra. For previous releases the branch is
named "bX.Y" where X.Y is the major+minor version; for example the "b1.6" branch
corresponds to the 1.6 release. The "master" branch will normally contain
development for the next connector release in progress.

Refer to the compatibility table below which shows the major.minor version range
supported between the connector, Apache Spark, Apache Cassandra, and the
Cassandra Java driver:

| Connector | Spark         | Cassandra | Cassandra Java Driver |
| --------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| 2.0       | 2.0           | 2.1.5*, 2.2, 3.0  | 3.0           |
| 1.6       | 1.6           | 2.1.5*, 2.2, 3.0  | 3.0           |
| 1.5       | 1.5, 1.6      | 2.1.5*, 2.2, 3.0  | 3.0           |
| 1.4       | 1.4           | 2.1.5*    | 2.1                   |
| 1.3       | 1.3           | 2.1.5*    | 2.1                   |
| 1.2       | 1.2           | 2.1, 2.0  | 2.1                   |
| 1.1       | 1.1, 1.0      | 2.1, 2.0  | 2.1                   |
| 1.0       | 1.0, 0.9      | 2.0       | 2.0                   |

**Compatible with 2.1.X where X >= 5*

[Tips for Developing the Spark Cassandra Connector](doc/developers.md)

Checklist for contributing changes to the project:
* Create a [SPARKC JIRA](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/projects/SPARKC/issues)
* Make sure that all unit tests and integration tests pass
* Add an appropriate entry at the top of CHANGES.txt
* If the change has any end-user impacts, also include changes to the ./doc files as needed
* Prefix the pull request description with the JIRA number, for example: "SPARKC-123: Fix the ..."
* Open a pull-request on GitHub and await review

## Testing
To run unit and integration tests:

    ./sbt/sbt test
    ./sbt/sbt it:test

By default, integration tests start up a separate, single Cassandra instance and run Spark in local mode.
It is possible to run integration tests with your own Cassandra and/or Spark cluster.
First, prepare a jar with testing code:
    
    ./sbt/sbt test:package
    
Then copy the generated test jar to your Spark nodes and run:    

    export IT_TEST_CASSANDRA_HOST=<IP of one of the Cassandra nodes>
    export IT_TEST_SPARK_MASTER=<Spark Master URL>
    ./sbt/sbt it:test
    
## Generating Documents
To generate the Reference Document use 

    ./sbt/sbt spark-cassandra-connector-unshaded/run (outputLocation)
    
outputLocation defaults to doc/reference.md
