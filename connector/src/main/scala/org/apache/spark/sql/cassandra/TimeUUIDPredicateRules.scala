/** All non-equal predicates on a TimeUUID column are going to fail and fail

  * a time UUID column in C* it compares based on the Time portion of the UUID. When
  * Spark executes this filter (unhandled behavior) it will compare lexically, this
  * will lead to results being incorrectly filtered out of the set. As long as the
  * range predicate is handled completely by the connector the correct result

         | You are attempting to do a non-equality comparison on a TimeUUID column in Spark.

         | different than the comparison done in C* which is done based on the Time Portion of
         | TimeUUID. This will in almost all cases lead to incorrect results. If possible restrict
         | doing a TimeUUID comparison only to columns which can be pushed down to Cassandra.
